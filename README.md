# Stereophonic Calculator

[![Build](https://github.com/svetter/stereocalc/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/svetter/stereocalc/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml)

Quickly find stereo microphone configurations for specific recording angles with this Android app.

Inspired by and based on the data of [Michael Williams](http://www.williamsmmad.com/)'s paper **"The stereophonic zoom"** ([PDF](https://www.gracedesign.com/support/StereoZoom10.pdf), [Citation](https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202598177)).

> The "Stereophonic Zoom" enables the sound recording engineer to get much nearer to the optimum result in the great majority of recording environments.

## Features

- Set a desired Stereophonic Recording Angle (SRA) and explore combinations of microphone distance and angle to achieve it
- Immediately see angular distortion and reverberation limits for each configuration
- Microphone type switchable to omni mode for finding _AB_ (spaced pair) configurations
- Live, to-scale **graphic representation** of the two microphones, showing distance and angle between them as well as the recording angle
- **Interactive graph of configuration space**, modeled after the figures in _The stereophonic zoom_ with a heat map for angular distortion and outlines of reverberation limits
- **Angle calculator** page for calculating a recording angle from basic length measurements
- **Presets** for widely used configurations: **ORTF, NOS, DIN**
- Programmable buttons for **user-defined** configurations
- Units switchable between metric and imperial
- Angles switchable between full and half (±)
